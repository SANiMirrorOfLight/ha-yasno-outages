> An integration for electricity outages plans by [Yasno][yasno].

This integration for [Home Assistant][home-assistant] provides information about electricity outages plans by [Yasno][yasno]: calendar of planned outages, time sensors for the next planned outages, and more.

This is a fork of the https://github.com/denysdovhan/ha-yasno-outages repository that was made to change the 5th queue calendar to match the Dnipro outage scheduler
